## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a Python-based IoT (Internet of Things) application for smart home control, specifically tailored for teenagers. It integrates with a Home Assistant API using HTTP requests to toggle devices like lights and temperature control units, based on environmental comfort.

## Features
üí° Turn indoor lights on/off based on brightness<br>
üå°Ô∏è Control temperature by activating/deactivating devices<br>
üîó Send webhook requests using Python requests library<br>
üë¶ User-centric logic optimized for young users' comfort<br>
üß™ Testable code with print outputs for device state<br>

## Usage
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the notebook or Python script to trigger the smart home functions:
```text
# Turn light ON
turn_11_on()

# Turn light OFF
turn_11_off()

# Activate temperature device
turn_12_on()

# Deactivate temperature device
turn_12_off()
```
All functions send POST requests to the designated Home Assistant webhooks using an authorization token.
