# AI Smart Home Appliances (Targeting the Improvement of Teenagers' Habits)
A smart home control system built in Python, designed for teenage users. It allows controlling devices such as lights and air conditioning via webhook requests. Developed as a semester project in a data structure course, the system focuses on comfort-based automation with clear and simple logic.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a Python-based IoT (Internet of Things) application for smart home control, specifically tailored for teenagers. It integrates with a Home Assistant API using HTTP requests to toggle devices like lights and temperature control units, based on environmental comfort.

## Features
üí° Lighting Control - Automatically toggle lights based on brightness comfort.<br>
üå°Ô∏è Temperature Control - Control heating/cooling devices depending on indoor temperature.<br>
üìä Google Sheets Logging - Log device status, timestamps, and user commands.<br>
üß™ Webhook API Integration - Trigger actions using secure HTTP POST requests.<br>
üìà Data-Driven Feedback - Use spreadsheet analysis to adjust automation thresholds.<br>

## Usage
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the notebook or Python script to trigger the smart home functions:
```text
# Turn light ON
turn_11_on()

# Turn light OFF
turn_11_off()

# Activate temperature device
turn_12_on()

# Deactivate temperature device
turn_12_off()
```
All functions send POST requests to the designated Home Assistant webhooks using an authorization token.
